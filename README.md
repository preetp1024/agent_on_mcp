# 🧠 MCP TweetAgent

**LLM-Powered Social Media Agent using the Model Context Protocol**

---

## 📌 Overview

**MCP TweetAgent** is a smart, context-aware agent that generates and posts tweets autonomously using OpenAI's LLMs and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Built with Node.js, it securely integrates with X (formerly Twitter) using OAuth 2.0 for Read/Write operations.

This project demonstrates how to combine **LLM-driven content generation** with **automated social media posting**, all orchestrated through an agent-based architecture with persistent context and memory handling.
